# IPLay

This repository contains the source code for the IPLay project, a simple supervised machine learning program that can classify whether a given IPL team will qualify for the playoffs or not.
The `script.py` file is responsible for the web scraping and data collection, while the `model.py` file is responsible for the machine learning model.
